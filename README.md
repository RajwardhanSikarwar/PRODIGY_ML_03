# Cat and Dog Image Classification using SVM

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an image classification model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. It was developed as part of the Machine Learning internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Task 03 Details
### Task Description
Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

### Approach
- Utilized a SVM algorithm to train a model on a dataset comprising cat and dog images.
- Explored various preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook (SVM_CatDog_Classification.ipynb): Contains code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Dataset folder: Includes the Kaggle dataset divided into cat and dog image directories.

## Guidelines
- Task completed as part of Prodigy InfoTech's Machine Learning internship program.
- LinkedIn posts detailing the completion of the task required.
- Certificates & LoR provided upon meeting program requirements.
